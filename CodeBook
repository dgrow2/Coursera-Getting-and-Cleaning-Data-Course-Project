This file contains information on the variables contained in both the data analysis, as 
well as in the data set

Variables in run_analysis.R

note: paticipants were initially divided into two groups a training set and test set
More detailed information on the raw data set can be found at
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

1.) subject_test = subject test data file which contains data on which subjects were 
in the test set

2.) x_test = contains the data on from the accelerometers during different activities. 
Each row is a different activity or subject

3.) Y_test = the key to say what activity id each participant should be assigned to each 
row in x_test data set

4.) subject_train = list of subjects that were in the training data set

5.) X_train = data from the accelermoters from the training set group

6.) Y_train = list of activity ids for the training set group

7.) Features = a description of the the source of the accelleromter data

8.) activity lables= a key describing what activity ID is assigned to a particular 
activity.

9.) trainData = handle for the data set containing all of the data from the training group
merged together

10.) testData = handle for the data set containing all of the data from the
test groups merged together

11.) totalData = all data from test and training groups merged together, with column names

12.) finalData = totalData with assigned activity types, describing what activity was 
being performed for each row in the data set

13.) tidy = finalData, grouped by activity type and subjectID


Variables in the tidy.txt
note* For the listed variables, several transforms were made to the data. the tidy.R analysis contains
only the mean and the standard deviation of each feature.

The first five columns of tidy.R are
1.) ActivityType Group = a decription of what activity was being performed 
2.) subject = the subjectID
3.) ActivityID = the ID code for the activity type
4.) ActivtyType= the type of activity being perfomred
5.) SujbectID the subject ID

the next 79 lines contain data that was extracted from the accleromters. In tidy.R, only data transforms that
included the mean or standard deviation were included:

"The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw 
signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were 
captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order 
low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the 
acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) 
using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals 
(tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated 
using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, 
fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
